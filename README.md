# Orange3

Orange is an visual programming software used for data mining, machine learning and data analysis. This repository shows the basic classification performed using Orange3. There are orange components known as widgets that allows data visualization, data preprocessing and evaluation of learning algorithms and predictive modeling.
The repository shows two files Test and Model.ows which performs classification using Orange3. The models in the tool are used to predict class labels of two different datasets and also, there are many ways to visualize the dataset. The best thing about this tool is you just have to drag and drop the model or visualization you want and therefore, you have the results without writing any python code.
